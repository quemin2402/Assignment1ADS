# Assignment 1, for the course Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description
This project is developed to solve common mathematical and algorithmic problems using a recursive solution method.
The work of the project can be used as a mechanism to understand the development and optimization of algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 21
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Installation
1. Copy the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/quemin2402/Assignment1ADS.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file located in the `src` directory to start the application.


## Usage explanation
The project itself is a 'console application', at the launch of which the user is offered a choice of one of the algorithms (1 out of 10).
Further, the output of the program depends on the user's choice. If a person selects any other options that do not meet the requirements, the program exits.

The message that the user sees when starting the program:
"Select an option (1-10) to execute a task, or any other key to exit:
1. Find minimum
2. Calculate average
3. Check if a number is prime
4. Calculate factorial
5. Fibonacci sequence element
6. Power calculation
7. Reverse array
8. Check digits in string
9. Calculate binomial coefficient
10. Find GCD of two numbers"

Further, after selecting one of the tasks, the program prompts the user to enter the values of one or more variables to execute the algorithm.
