# Assignment 1, for the course Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description 
This project is developed to solve common mathematical and algorithmic problems using a recursive solution method.
The work of the project can be used as a mechanism to understand the development and optimization of algorithms.

## Usage explanation
The project itself is a 'console application', at the launch of which the user is offered a choice of one of the algorithms (1 out of 10).
Further, the output of the program depends on the user's choice. If a person selects any other options that do not meet the requirements, the program exits.
